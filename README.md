# 📚 Project Overview

Food classification is an important application in AI-powered nutrition tracking and dietary analysis. This project trains a ResNet-50 model to classify 11 food categories with high accuracy. I fine-tuned the model and used Grad-CAM to visualize predictions.

📌 Key Features  
👉 Pre-trained ResNet-50 with fine-tuning  
👉 Food-11 Dataset for classification  
👉 Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability  
👉 Streamlit app for real-time predictions  

# 💂️ Dataset Information

The Food-11 dataset consists of a training set with a total of 9,900 images, each class containing 900 images, and a test set with a total of 1,100 images, each class containing 100 images, making a total of 11,000 images.

📌 Classes:    

🥧 **Apple Pie**, 🍰 **Cheese Cake**, 🍛 **Chicken Curry**, 🍟 **French Fries**, 🍚 **Fried Rice**,  
🍔 **Hamburger**, 🌭 **Hot Dog**, 🍦 **Ice-cream**, 🍳 **Omelette**, 🍕 **Pizza**, 🍣 **Sushi**

# 🛠️ Model Architecture

The model is based on ResNet-50 with a custom classifier:

```
(fc): Sequential(
  (0): Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=512, bias=True)
  (1): BatchNorm1d(512)
  (2): ReLU()
  (3): Dropout(p=0.3)
  (4): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=11, bias=True)
)
```

📌 Why ResNet-50?  
  
✅ Transfer learning for better performance  
✅ Handles complex food textures  
✅ Efficient feature extraction
